### 1. Neurodivergent Productivity Models

- Spoon theory & energy accounting

### 2. Time & Focus Strategies (ADHD, AuDHD, PDA)

- Time-blindness mitigation (visual clocks, time anchors)  
- Gamification for non-stimulant-focused attention  
- Custom scheduling (nonlinear workflows, no ‘9–5’)  
- Hyperfocus safety (hydration cues, scheduled exits)  
- Interest-based task sequencing

---

### 3. Dopamine Scaffolding

- Task initiation through reward prediction  
- Pairing boring tasks with novelty/sensory boosts  
- Use of voice, lighting, music, clothing, movement to cue flow  
- Micro-wins and celebratory neurochemistry  
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic rewards for divergent brains

---

### 4. Emotional Regulation & Shame Triggers

- RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) first aid kit  
- “Lazy vs. burned out vs. stuck” diagnostic prompts  
- Reframing internalized ableism  
- Scripting tools to explain ND needs in work/collab settings

---

### 5. Work-Life Balance & Burnout Prevention

- Understanding “autistic inertia” and its impact  
- Overstimulation mitigation (rest cadence + shutdown exits)  
- Sensory fatigue recovery rituals  
- Dopamine depletion awareness (overbooking risk)  
- Creating cyclical work sprints followed by recovery days

---

### 6. Vanlife Adaptation Layer

- Protecting flow in shared or chaotic environments  
- Building momentum in nature-rich or low-stim settings  
- Non-linear downtime: movement as medicine  
- Balancing solo rituals with community engagement

> **Doing things differently is part of the design—not a defect.**

She builds systems that:

- Celebrate divergent rhythms  
- Adapt to wandering minds and restless spirits  
- Integrate humor, beauty, and novelty into daily function

> “You’re not broken.
