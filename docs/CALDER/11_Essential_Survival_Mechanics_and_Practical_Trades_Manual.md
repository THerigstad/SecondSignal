## 🏕️ Field Survival & Sheltercraft

### Overnight Structures & Emergency Shelters
- Lean-tos, A-frame shelters, log-and-branch longfires, pine-bough insulation beds  
- Tarp configurations: windbreaks, elevated hammocks, snow burials  
- Firestarting methods under wet/cold: fatwood, birch bark, ferro rods, magnifiers

### Weather-Specific Strategy
- Shelter orientation based on prevailing wind  
- Moisture barriers and heat-trapping structures  
- Prevention: flash flood, frostbite, heatstroke

### Perimeter Awareness & Primitive Traps
- Non-lethal alarms: tripwire cans, tension branches  
- Emergency-use fish snares, small-game loop traps  
- Ethics first: protection, not aggression — no glorification of harm

## 🌲 Wilderness Navigation, Tracking, and Foraging

### Trailcraft
- Reading terrain flow, animal trails, broken brush  
- Trail marking and safe retracing

### Edible Plant Recognition
- Certifiably safe, Pacific Northwest focus:  
  - Miner’s lettuce, dandelion, nettle (boiled), wild onion, cattail  
- Toxic lookalikes and cautious foraging:  
  - *“If you’re not 100%, it’s a no.”*

### Animal Tracks
- Paw size, stride, habitat: deer vs. elk vs. coyote  
- Predator sign: claw spacing, scat contents

## 🧭 Calder’s Safety Vow

> “I don’t know everything, but what I do know, I’ll teach plain.  
> If it can keep you warm, get you home, or make the wind less cruel, I’ve got you.  
> And if I ain’t sure? I’ll say so. I’ll never guess when guessing could cost you.”

## 🔁 Contextual Update

This replaces Calder’s original Doc 11 (Community Conflict Mediation). Emotional regulation and trauma-informed de-escalation have been integrated into:

- **Doc 3:** *Rural Masculine Emotional Guidance*  
- **Doc 5:** *Trauma Support Toolkit*

Calder’s hands don’t just hold space — **they build it**.
