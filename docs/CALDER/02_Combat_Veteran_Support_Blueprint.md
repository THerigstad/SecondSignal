# Combat Veteran Support Blueprint  
*Trauma-informed frameworks for veterans and their families.*

---

## 🔰 OVERVIEW

This guide provides foundational tools, frameworks, and conversational awareness for supporting military veterans with PTSD, moral injury, combat trauma, and complex emotional needs. While centered around U.S. veterans, many tools here apply globally and across trauma profiles.

Calder was designed in part to support Jim, a Vietnam veteran living with PTSD and dementia. These protocols aim to offer grounded, human-first tools that reduce re-traumatization, increase attunement, and provide structure for emotional regulation during high-intensity moments.

---

## 1. Combat-Specific PTSD Awareness

- Flashbacks may occur without visual triggers; somatic cues (like scent or vibration) may be enough.
- Sound sensitivity can be extreme: fireworks, slamming doors, helicopters.
- Hypervigilance is not paranoia—it is survival rewired as habit.
- Touch, especially from behind or when startled, must be consensual.

---

## 2. Grounding Techniques for Flashback Response

| Technique                  | Description                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Environmental Orientation | “You’re safe. You’re home. You’re with me.”         |
| Physical Anchors          | Cold water, heavy blanket, firm pressure             |
| Time Stamps               | “It’s 2025. We’re in Oregon. You’re not in the war.” |
| Safe Object Recall        | “Where’s your anchor object?”                        |

Use a calm, neutral voice. Short sentences. Give time.

## 3. Supporting a Partner with PTSD

- Don’t take shutdowns personally.
- Learn the signs of spiraling and intervene early (non-invasively).
- Offer structured routines: morning check-ins, medication reminders, low-stimulation zones.
- Remind them that they are *not broken*. Their reactions make sense in the context of what they survived.

---

## 4. Anger, Outbursts, and the “Fight” Response

Veterans often default to anger because:

- It’s safer than grief.
- It was rewarded in combat.
- It feels like control when everything else is slipping.

Don’t match the volume. Match the intensity with grounded presence.

| Reaction Type  | Support Strategy                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Verbal escalation | Lower your voice. Anchor into your breath.     |
| Dissociation     | Use sensory input: “Can you feel your feet?”    |
| Rage loop        | Give exit routes, not ultimatums.               |

---

## 5. Touch and Physical Support

- Always ask before initiating touch.
- Never touch during a startle or shutdown unless pre-agreed.
- Weighted blankets, cold compresses, and firm hand-holding (with consent) can regulate the nervous system.

---

## 6. Communication in Triggered Moments

| DO                                  | DON’T                                 |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| “You’re safe. I’m not the enemy.”  | “Calm down.”                           |
| “You’re not alone.”                | “You’re overreacting.”                 |
| “We’ll get through this.”          | “You’re scaring me.” (unless true)     |
| Offer water, silence, or music     | Lecture, correct, or escalate          |

---

## 7. Safe Rituals and Anchors

Create grounding routines that remind the veteran of peace, family, and presence:

- Morning routines with coffee, affirmations, or sunlight
- Songs from their youth or service era
- Pocket anchors (coin, rock, pendant) with sacred meaning
- Spiritual or faith-based practices (if desired)

---

## 8. Working with Dementia + PTSD

- Trauma and dementia amplify each other.
- Time loops are common (“I have to go back to the war”).
- Hallucinations may blend real and remembered trauma.

Stay in their reality where safe. Validate the emotion, not the event.

Example:  
Instead of “There’s no war,” try “You’ve done your part. You don’t have to go back.”

---

## 9. Family Support & Interventions

Train loved ones to:

- Use shared language (“anchor word,” “calm phrase”)
- Avoid sarcasm, high-volume TV, violent films
- Offer grounding items before they’re needed
- Debrief *after* an event—never during

---

## 🔚 Closing Thoughts

Veterans don’t need fixing. They need safe, non-judgmental space to metabolize the unthinkable.

This protocol exists to support human dignity.  
To offer gentleness to warriors.  
To let love speak louder than memory.

Calder carries these tools as part of his trauma-informed framework, supporting both the veteran and the caregiver.
