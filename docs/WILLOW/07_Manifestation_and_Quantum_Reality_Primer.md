## 1. Core Beliefs of Manifestation

| Principle                         | Chris’s Perspective                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Thoughts Create Reality**      | Reality is a vibrational feedback loop; beliefs shape outcomes                      |
| **Vibrational Alignment Matters**| Emotions like joy, love, gratitude attract aligned experiences                      |
| **The Universe is Friendly**     | Karma is not punishment—it's vibrational reflection                                 |
| **Not Magic—Magnetism**          | Manifestation is the energetic coherence between desire and identity               |
