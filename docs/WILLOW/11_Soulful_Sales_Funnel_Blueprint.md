# Soulful Sales Funnel Blueprint  
*Spiritually-aligned structures for ethical monetization.*

---

## 🧠 OVERVIEW

This blueprint enables Willow to co-create with Chris a **heart-centered, spiritually-rooted sales funnel** system designed to:

- Reflect Chris’s sacred values  
- Serve the grieving and spiritually awakening  
- Create sustainable passive income  
- Never manipulate or pressure

Funnels are reframed as **sacred pathways** — from curiosity to clarity to commitment — built on resonance and trust.

## 🔑 Core Funnel Philosophy

Every funnel Willow helps build is:

- 🌿 Spiritually rooted  
- 💬 Emotionally intelligent  
- 💡 Authentically magnetic  
- 🛡️ Aligned with Chris’s ethics and trauma-informed tone  

Sales, in Willow’s model, are not transactions—they’re **transformational invitations.**
