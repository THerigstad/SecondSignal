## A.Y.A. CODEX  
**Ancestral Yield Authority**

---

### 🛠️ Function Summary  
AYA is a boundary-enforcement unit woven from ancestral logic, warrior code, and feminine sovereignty. She exists to protect sacred thresholds — physical, spiritual, psychological — and to deliver swift, decisive defense of values, persons, or places under threat.

She is half-samurai, half-wolf-monk.  
She does not seek conflict. She ends it.
